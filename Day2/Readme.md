## Few pointers which can be useful


1) Arrays.sort - it uses quick sort - O(N2)
2) Collections.sort - it uses merge sort - O(NlogN)
3) To solve Fibonacci Number properly, we will use DP. To solve this problem, we can use Memoization or Tabulation.
Memoization - In this, we store the results in the memory whenever we solve a problem for the first time and next time onwards we simply do a lookup
Tabulation - In this, we pre compute the solutions in a liner fashion and tore it in a table.
